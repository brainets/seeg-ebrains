# Tools for the analysis of intracranial SEEG data from EBRAINS
Jupyter notebooks for the analysis of task-related iEEG data from the Human Intracranial Database (HID) of EBRAINS using information theoretical measures and task-related functional connectivity implemented in the Frites Python toolbox.

The repository contains scripts for loading, preprocessing and analyzing task-related iEEG data of the HID present on EBRAINS.

It also contains Matlab code for Shape Mediation Analysis based on this preprint
