Files description:
g_shape_quick.m: the shape model, launch it without argument to run a parameter recovery analysis
SEEG_Preproc_and_Shape_Fit.m: Preprocess SEEG data, fit the shape model and save results
perElec_SEEG_Mediation_Analysis_Response_Shape.m: Run the mediation analysis and visualise the results
shadedErrorBar.m: visualisation function (not mine)

To run the project, run the two scripts SEEG_Preproc_and_Shape_Fit.m and perElec_SEEG_Mediation_Analysis_Response_Shape.m one after another. The first may takes days, the second minutes.
